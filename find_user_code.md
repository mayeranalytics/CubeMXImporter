# find\_user\_code.py #

## Overview ##

This python script scans a input directory for sections like these

```
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */
  // some code here...
  /* USER CODE END 1 */
```

and prints them out. Why?

The file tree generated by the [STMCubeMX](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM147/CL1794/SC961/SS1533/PF259242) tool contains a bare bones firmware for one of the STM MCUs of [STMicroelectronics](http://www.st.com). The CubeMXImporter by Carmine Noviello automatically merges this file tree with an existing STM32 MCU Eclipse project. During the merge many of the files, such as `main.c` will be overwritten and all user source code will be lost.

While experimenting with STCubeMX projects this can be quite annoying. As a first step towards improving the situation this script scans an existing Eclipse project and prints out all the user content.

STM identifies user content with section like the one shown above. The `find_user_code.py` tool just scans through all source code files and prints out the user code so that it can be manually inserted later - if necessary.

## Usage ##

```
usage: find_user_code.py [-h] eclipse_project_folder

Use find_user_code.py to dump the user code groups for all files in a eclipse
project.

positional arguments:
  eclipse_project_folder
                        an integer for the accumulator

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
